    "The purpose of this project is to study how well Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree machine learning algorithms can indentify emails by their authors. There will be comparinsons among them as to their respective performance and accuracy based on a pre-made list of email texts and the corresponding authors based on Enron dataset comprised of 146 users with 21 features each.\n",

    "The Enron scandal, publicized in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which was one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure."
