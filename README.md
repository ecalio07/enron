# Fraud Detection Machine Learning on Enron Enteprise Dataset

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a reproducible paper regarding studies on how well Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithms can indentify emails by their authors using a pre-processed list of email texts and the corresponding authors based on the text dataset(comprised of 146 users with 21 features each) of the famous fraud scandal of the american bankrupt Enron Corporation. We will also study ways to work with parameters to improve accuracy and performance.

**NB:** All contents and instructions used for this paper where based on the **"Udacity - Introduction to Machine Leaning course"**, and were adaped according to the goals explained here. This is being used for **educational pourposes only**.

## Environment
This project essencially makes use of the following tools:
* Docker and Jupyter Notebook
* Python Scripts
* Scikit-learn libraries

## Structure

The files sctructure in GitHub is the same one to have in jupyter notebook:

* /data: Holds the dataset files (email_authors.pkl and  word_data), preprocessed by Katie Malone for Udacity machine learning training course.

* /dev: In this directory it is available **.ipynb files** that are imported by the main file in deliver folder

* /deliver: Refer to the most recent **.ipynb** file in this folder as the main stable reproducible paper:<br>

* /figures: Contains image files imported and displayed by the main files.
