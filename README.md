# Fraud Detection Machine Learning on Enron Enteprise Dataset

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a **reproducible paper** regarding studies on how well Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree machine learning algorithms can indentify emails by their authors using a pre-processed list of email texts and the corresponding authors based on the text dataset(comprised of 146 users with 21 features each) of the famous fraud scandal of the american bankrupt Enron Corporation.

**NB:** All contents used for this paper where based on the **"Udacity - Introduction to Machine Leaning course"**, and were adaped according to the goals explained here. This is being used for **educational pourposes only**.

## Environment
This project essencially makes use of the following tools:
* Docker and Jupyter Notebook
* Python Scripts
* Scikit-learn libraries

## Structure and Files for Reprodutibility
**Data:** The dataset files are named **email_authors.pkl** and **word_data** which has been developed by Katie Malone for Udacity machine learning training course.

**Dev:** In this directory it is available minor releases of our reproducible papers using jupyter notebook. Scripts and text procedures are embeded in the **.ipynb files**. 

Please, note that this has been made available only to display the evolution of the project. For the most stable verstion, please refer to files contained in the **Deliver** folder.

**Deliver:** Refer to the file in this folder as the main stable reproducible paper. 

**Environment:** Contains DOCKER version, an alternative way to reproduce the experiments without having to set up installation of tools by yourself. 

**Figures:** Contains image files imported and displayed by the main files.

**Tools:** Contains the auxiliary commom .py files imported by main scripts embeded in the papers.
