# Fraud Detection Machine Learning on Enron Enteprise Dataset

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a reproducible paper regarding studies on how well Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithms can indentify emails by their authors using a pre-processed list of email texts and the corresponding authors based on the text dataset(comprised of 146 users with 21 features each) of the famous fraud scandal of the american bankrupt Enron Corporation. We will also study ways to work with parameters to improve accuracy and performance.

**NB:** All contents and instructions used for this paper where based on the **"Udacity - Introduction to Machine Leaning course"**, and were adaped according to the goals explained here. This is being used for **educational pourposes only**.
