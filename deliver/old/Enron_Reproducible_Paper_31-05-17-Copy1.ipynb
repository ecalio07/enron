    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to provide a reproducible paper regarding studies on how well Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithms can indentify emails by their authors using a pre-processed list of email texts and the corresponding authors based on the text dataset(comprised of 146 users with 21 features each) of the famous fraud scandal of the american bankrupt Enron Corporation. We will also study ways to work with parameters to improve accuracy and performance.\n",

    "It will be performed arguments confirguration according to each classifier below so as to reach best time performance and accurance, as well as comparisons of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company . Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email.\n",

    "A couple of years ago, J.K. Rowling (of Harry Potter fame) tried something interesting. She wrote a book, “The Cuckoo’s Calling,” under the name Robert Galbraith. The book received some good reviews, but no one paid much attention to it--until an anonymous tipster on Twitter said it was J.K. Rowling. The London Sunday Times enlisted two experts to compare the linguistic patterns of “Cuckoo” to Rowling’s “The Casual Vacancy,” as well as to books by several other authors. After the results of their analysis pointed strongly toward Rowling as the author, the Times directly asked the publisher if they were the same person, and the publisher confirmed. The book exploded in popularity overnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll do something very similar in this project. We have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company . Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email. We will start with Naive Bayes in this mini-project, and then expand in later projects to other algorithms.\n"

    "\n",
    "It is consider the holy grail of probrabilist inference. It is based on Revend Thomas Bayes who used this principles (Bayes Rules) to infer the existence of God. He created a family of methods who influenced artificial inteligence and statistics. It uses in its algorithm the concepts of sensitivity and specitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm used substancially in learning from documents (text learning). Each word is considered a feature and user names are considered the labes. It is called Naive because it ignores the words order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier uses Posterior Probability, giving the rank occurance provided text. In order words, it will be trained with frequent texts(features) used by Chris and Sarah(labels), and it will calculate the probabily and determine if each test email is from Chris or Sara."
