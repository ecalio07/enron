    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to provide a reproducible paper regarding studies on how well Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithms can indentify emails by their authors using a pre-processed list of email texts and the corresponding authors based on the text dataset(comprised of 146 users with 21 features each) of the famous fraud scandal of the american bankrupt Enron Corporation. We will also study ways to work with parameters to improve accuracy and performance.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " In the years 2001/2002, Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston(Texas), went bankrupt due to a fraud scandal. After this scandal, many rules and regulations were changed to be able to audit and prenvent cases like this one. \n",
    " \n",
    "After some time part of Enron Corporation data was made available to the public for learning pourposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the original [dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/), new data versions were created so as to have more options to explore by using Machine Learning. And since machine learning is vatly used nowadays, enron data became a good option as a text source to be explored by machine learning."

    "It will be performed arguments confirguration according to each classifier below so as to reach best time performance and accurance, as well as comparisons of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company . Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to know which algorithm is best for this situation, we should make tests and by the results determine which one is most suitable for our scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of years ago, J.K. Rowling (of Harry Potter fame) tried something interesting. She wrote a book, “The Cuckoo’s Calling,” under the name Robert Galbraith. The book received some good reviews, but no one paid much attention to it--until an anonymous tipster on Twitter said it was J.K. Rowling. The London Sunday Times enlisted two experts to compare the linguistic patterns of “Cuckoo” to Rowling’s “The Casual Vacancy,” as well as to books by several other authors. After the results of their analysis pointed strongly toward Rowling as the author, the Times directly asked the publisher if they were the same person, and the publisher confirmed. The book exploded in popularity overnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll do something very similar in this project. We have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company . Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email. We will start with Naive Bayes in this mini-project, and then expand in later projects to other algorithms.\n",

    "For each experiment, there will be a cell (below descriptions) to reproduce results and the option to access the code and have the chance to change values for other results.\n"
